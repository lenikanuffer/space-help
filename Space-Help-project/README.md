# Space Help

Space Help is an Single Page Application to gamify the decluttering process.
This is a modified method based on 'The mins game'.

The welcome screen will give the user the option to decide the number of items they want to eliminate that day.

In the future, there will be as well the posibility to select between 3 levels of declutter (one between 1 to 3 items per day, 1 to 10, and the complete challenge).

In every challenge, there will be a number of illustrations on the screen, which represent the items to eliminate. On toggle, the user will be able to change the illustrations color to select if the item is for donation, throwing or selling.

A progression page will keep record of the number of items eliminated, the number of donation, and for sale.
